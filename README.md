# FlowSniffer
My Experiment for University Work, anyway, is a rough project, but it may help you.

### My Config
1. Operation System: Ubuntu 22.04 as an attack, Kali/Win11 as a target

2. IDE: QT 5.12.12

3. programming language: C, C++, bash

### Please see the following things:
1. You need two virtual machines on your PC, in my config: they are Ubuntu 22.04 and Kali the latest one (I forgot, sorry, but never mind)

2. You need QT 5.12.12 or higher on your attack host and set the target host can receive the arp reply without requesting it.

3. You need some C or C++ basic knowledge about libpcap library and socket.

4. You need to install servers on your virtual machines before running the application. Ubuntu--vsftpd Kali--apache

5. You need bash knowledge to use the function of sniffing because I use the bash scripts to make C and QT suitable.

There may have some Chinese words because I use English and Chinese at the same time, but you can search for them.
