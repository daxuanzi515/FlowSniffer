# FlowSniffer
My Experiment for University work anyway it is a rough project but it may help you.

### My Config
1.os: Ubuntu 22.04 as attack, Kali/Win11 as target

2.IDE: QT 5.12.12

3.programming language: C, C++, bash

### Please see the following things:
1.You need two virtual machines in your PC, in my config : they are Ubuntu 22.04 and Kali the lastest(I forgot sorry but never mind)

2.You need QT 5.12.12 or higher on your attack host and set the target host can receive the arp reply without requesting it.

3.You need some C or C++ basic knowledge about lipcap and socket packet.

4.You need to install servers on your virtual machines before running the application. Ubuntu--vsftpds Kali--apache

5.You need bash knowledge to use the funtion of sniffering, because I use the bash scripts to make C and QT suitable.

Some Chinese words maybe, I use English and Chinese at the same time, but you can search for them please.
